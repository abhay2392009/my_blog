      <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. 

        The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.
        
        The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. 
        
        And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!</p>

      <p>In a word, amazing!!!!!!!
        In other words, it’s the kind of experience that you have to see to believe!!!!
        
        Packed with action, emotion, and surprises, Spider-Man No Way Home is franchise fan service at it’s finest…
        
        Spider-Man No Way Home honestly reached my skyscraper high expectations, which is an impressive achievement itself.
        A true celebration of decades of Spider-Man love, this is a film for the fans and clearly made by fans too.
        
        Now I hardly get overly emotional over films, but this one had me in my feelings by the end of it…
        The fact that all three Spider-Men that I grew up watching were all in the same film is extremely cool!!!!!!
        I am glad that I was able to experience that in the same room with so many other people!!!!!!
        It’s definitely a moment I will never forget!
        My screening was almost packed and for the first time ever, people actually cheered!!!!!!!
        I’m from the UK and that is NOT a common thing like it is in the US…
        Not everyone cheered unfortunately but it was enough for me to realise just how important these characters mean to some people…including me!!!!!!!
        As soon as Andrew Garfield came through that portal, people went crazy!!!!!!!!!!
        
        Spider-Man No Way Home is absolutely breathtaking!!!!!!
        Believe the hype and go and experience this once in a lifetime cinematic experience!!!!!!!
        Spider-Man No Way Home delivers on everything that I wanted to see and so much more too!!!!!
        This is honestly one of my favourite films of all time!
        It might even be my favourite Spider-Man film too…
        Tom Holland really gives it his all in this film to be honest!
        He gives by far his most emotional performance yet as the famous Web-head!
        By the end of the film he really does become that iconic Spider-Man that we all know and love…
        I love how the film goes back to the traditional Spider-Man; living by himself, listening to police radios, designing his own suit by hand and then eventually swinging around New York.
        Now that is Spider-Man!!!!!!
        I find it incredibly interesting how after 5 years of seeing Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, we haven’t really seen his origin story? Until now that is…
        
        Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are absolutely terrific in this film to be honest!!!!!!
        Although I absolutely adore Tom Holland as Spider-Man, it was Maguire and Garfield that I was looking forward to seeing the most…
        I honestly had my fingers crossed throughout; hoping they would appear…and then they did!
        I honestly couldn’t believe my eyes to be honest!!!!!!!!
        Seeing the pair of them together onscreen after all of these years is truly extraordinary to be honest?
        I never thought in a million years, I would see either of them again in this role to be honest?!
        It’s truly incredible how Marvel and Sony managed to bring them back and keep it all a big secret for literally two years!!!!!!! 
        I can’t believe I am alive in a time where I get to see three generations of Spider-Man onscreen!!!!
        All three of them are amazing in their own ways to be honest.
        But Tobey Maguire will always be my Spider-Man, because he is the reason why I absolutely love and adore Spider-Man!!!!!!! 
        But you could really tell how much both of them wanted to be in this film, especially Garfield…
        Garfield is sensational in this film to be honest.
        He really surprised me actually!!!!
        I honestly forgot how great he is as this character?!
        Seeing all three of them working together, joking around, learning about each other put a MASSIVE smile on my face!!!!!!</p>
